## Instructions

- Create a native UIKit or SwiftUI based application written in Swift that consumes the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and meets the requirements in the section below.
- Although not mandatory, we will really appreciate it if you are willing to spend some extra time and complete as many bonus points as possible.
- Push your solution to a private repo on your Github account.
- Share the repo with us.

## Requirements

- There must be a search bar to let the user search by username (login name).
- After the search is completed, the application displays a list of users along with their avatar and username on the same page. To simplify the exercise, in case there are too many results you can limit them to a certain maximum.
- When a list item is tapped, the application navigates to a new page that displays a simple list with all the user details.
- The new page will also display the list of the user's repositories and followers.
- The application UI should look fine on both iPad and iPhone and in different orientations.

## Bonus

- Include a README.MD file with details about the solution documented (documents linked won't be considered)
- The search input does the searching as you type (See google search as an example)
- Persist the data locally
- Add unit tests
- Paginate the list of results
